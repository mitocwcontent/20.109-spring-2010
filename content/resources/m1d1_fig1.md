description: Depicted are two complementary strands of DNA, with a desired target
  fragment shown in green. Primers that can select the target sequence are shown as
  short arrows, with the dotted lines indicating the extension step of PCR. Note that
  in the first couple rounds of PCR, products longer than the desired target will
  be made (dotted lines keep extending). However, these early products themselves
  become templates that produce the correct product in abundance.
