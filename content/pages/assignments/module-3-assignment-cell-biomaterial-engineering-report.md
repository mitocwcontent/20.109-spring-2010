Data Summary
------------

### Overview

The culminating written assignment for Module 3 will be relatively informal. You should continue to strive for clear writing and thorough explanations, but you do not have to make beautiful figures or polish every last word. Keep in mind that the summaries you write today may be used by students during next spring’s offering of 20.109. Consider what information you would want to see as a student just beginning the third module, and then do your best to convey it.

At a minimum, you should introduce the experimental question you investigated (with links to publications if appropriate), describe your results (in text, tables, and perhaps 2-3 figures), then interpret your findings and discuss implications for future work. The introduction and discussion might only be about 1 long paragraph (or perhaps 2 shorter ones) each.

Although you need not include common methodological details, it is exceedingly important that you write down any such information unique to your experiment (number of cells analyzed, quantity of RNA used in RT-PCR, etc).

### Collaboration and Integrity

For this assignment _**only**_, you and your partner may share figures and figure captions if you wish. However, all of the supporting text should be written individually.

### Logistics

This assignment is due by 5 PM on your final wet lab day.
