For Next Time
-------------

*   If you presented for journal club today...
    *   An awareness of your own strengths and weaknesses can often help you improve your future work. After you give your presentation today, write a brief self-evaluation. Specifically, describe (in a short phrase or sentence each) two things that you thought you did well, and two that could use improvement. Feel free to include both big-picture and detail-oriented comments. This assignment is due by email within **48 hours** after your presentation.
