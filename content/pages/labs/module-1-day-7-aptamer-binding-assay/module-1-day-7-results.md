(This is estimating final concentration to be 50% 8-12). However, we corrected this by decreasing the amount of heme so that it was still a 1:1 ratio. Therefore, the results should not have been affected. Normalization was used to correct for the heme curve, which was lower than all the other curves. Enrichment values were close to expected ones (50%) but slightly surprising that 8 washes enriched a bit more than 16 washes. {{< br >}}{{< br >}} {{< /td-colspan >}} |||

The other graphs seem consistent with the fact that 8-12 graph should be higher horizontally than the 6-5 graph, with the heights increasing in the following order: mix 10% pre, mix 10% post 4x, post 24x, and 8-12 aptamer. {{< br >}}{{< br >}} {{< /td-colspan >}} |||

The values for our post-selection 8-12 percentages make sense but do not exactly correspond to our predictions. We thought that with 8 washes, we'd get about 50% 8-12, but instead we got 80% (meaning our binding assay sample was diluted to less than 8 mM). For 16 washes, we predicted 75% which is close enough to 72% found experimentally. It seems like 8 washes is closer to the ideal number of washes in contrast to our original prediction that 16X would be more optimal. The horizontal peak shifts on our graph are consistent with our findings based on the vertical shifts. {{< br >}}{{< br >}} {{< /td-colspan >}} ||
